ABOUT

Jimm is a native ICQ clone for Java 2 Platform Micro Edition (J2ME), Mobile
Information Device Profile (MIDP) 1.0. It supports the new v8 protocol, former
protocols are not supported.

Jimm is probably the most lightweight ICQ clone available, so please do not
expect the same features your favourite desktop client has. Currently, Jimm has
the following features:

  *  Request and read the server side contact list
  *  Send plain messages (type 1)
  *  Receive plain messages (type 1, 2 and 4, and offline messages)
  *  Send URL messages (type 4)
  *  Receive URL messages (type 1, 2 and 4, and offline messages)
  *  Set your status (away, n/a, etc.)
  *  Receive status updates (user is away, n/a, etc.)
  *  Request information about another user
  *  Remove users from the server side contact list
  *  Search for users
  *  Add users to the server side contact list
  *  Answer authorization requests
  *  Multilingual user interface

Jimm does not support peer to peer connections (and will never do so), all
messages are routed through the central ICQ/AIM server by using a single
persistent TCP/IP connection.

HOW TO INSTALL

Copy Jimm.jad and Jimm.jar (found inside the bin directory) to your mobile
phone. If you have a Siemens Mobile, use the files found inside the bin/siemens
directory. Follow the instructions in your mobile phone manual to start the Java
application.

At first start-up, select 'Options' and set your UIN and password. The default
values for the ICQ server host and port should be okay. Option values are
automatically saved and loaded on subsequent start-ups.

You can also download Jimm.jad and Jimm.jar via WAP. Open the following URL with
your WAP device and select the desired version:
<http://jimm.sourceforge.net/download/>

________________________________________________________________________________
KNOWN BUGS

On Siemens S55 mobiles there are the following graphical errors:

  * In the ICQ Flowers if there is an active chat
  * In the chat histroy the name is shifted left
    (Both depend on errors on the S55 and they might be fixed by Siemens in
    upcoming firmware releases)

The background of the flowers if there is an active chat is no longer
transparent.

________________________________________________________________________________
HOW TO BUILD

Jimm uses Apache Ant for building. You can download Apache Ant from
<http://ant.apache.org/>. Follow the instructions in the Apache Ant manual to
install Apache Ant.

You also must have a Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE) SDK and the
Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) SDK 1.0.3. You can download both from
<http://java.sun.com/>. Make sure not to download the new MIDP SDK 2.0.

By default, class files are obfuscated using ProGuard to reduce bytecode size.
You can download ProGuard from <http://proguard.sourceforge.net/>. Follow the
instructions in the ProGuard manual to install ProGuard.

At first, open the Apache ant buildfiles (build.xml, util/sijapp/build.xml)
and change the properties in the configuration/customization section. You can
use both the slash and the backslash for separating path components.

To build Jimm, just type 'ant' or 'ant dist'. To disable class file
obfuscation, add '-Dskip-obfuscate=1' to the before mentioned command. If
everything goes well, look at the newly created directory dist/bin for
Jimm.jar and Jimm.jad files.

To clean the distribution, type 'ant clean'.

________________________________________________________________________________
PERFORMANCE

Jimm takes about 20 seconds to load on a Siemens S55 mobile phone. Logging into
ICQ again takes about 20 seconds. These will vary depending on your mobile phone
processor and memory performance, bandwidth and contact list size. Because of
performance limitations of most J2ME devices, it is strongly recommended to
reduce your contact list size to 50 contacts.

Delays at message sending/receiving are negligible and can be ignored.

Currently, Jimm requires about 250 KB of RAM, depending on the size of your
contact list, and the activity on the ICQ network. Jimm also requires support
for socket (TCP/IP) connections, which *is not* required to be
standard-compliant but some vendor implementations include. Check your mobile
phone manual.

NETWORK CONSUMPTION

The following information, as all other information in this file and all
other files included in this Jimm distribution, ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. Please see the file COPYING in the Jimm distribution for
further details.

Jimm establishes a single TCP connection to login.icq.com:5190 (by default).
This connection is held open until you choose to disconnect or a critical error
occurs.

Logging into ICQ produces about 5 KB network traffic, excluding your server-side
contact list. The contact list is locally cached, and only requested again from
the server if the cache is out of date.

There is also some network traffic while staying online, even when you don't
send or receive any instant messages. Jimm sends a Keepalive packet every 120
seconds, which includes 6 bytes payload. This can be disabled. Each time one of
your buddies changes status, you'll receive at least a notification and,
depending on the ICQ client you buddy uses, some capability messages.

Jimm adds a 20 bytes long string to all outgoing instant messages, stating
that the message was sent using Jimm. Go to the options form to disable this.
The more people use Jimm, the faster Jimm becomes stable - think about it.

Tip 1: Reduce your contact list size to save network traffic.
Tip 2: Check the network consumption regularly.
